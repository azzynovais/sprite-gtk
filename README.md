This is a fork of Zorin-OS-Modern that was seen in gnome-looks, I fixed and made it more looking and correct
All the right goes to Zorin Group and their design team along the original GTK theme creator
### Sprite GTK
An theme made for Cinnamon desktop that reflects a bit of ZorinOS guidelines in UI styling, but since Cinnamon themes are lacking or broken or not able to be used properly

## How to install?
Download the .zip, open the file navigator of Cinnamon or what you use, press CTRL + H to see hidden files, put what is inside themes on your .themes folder, now apply it on "Themes" on Cinnamon settings

## Root-wise
Download the .zip, extract it on some folder then open the file navigator, and go to /usr/share/themes, and open it as Sudo using "Open as Root", also get the extracted folder of the theme, and then put it on /usr/share/themes, and then apply it with "Themes" on Cinnamon Settings
